# SubSim_SPGL
First go with this simple game library as a learning tool getting to know python.

The purpose of the Simple Python Game Library is to give beginning Python coders a simple framework to make basic 2D games. 
It is intended as an alternative to Pygame. As it is built on the Turtle module, it has the same features and limitations of that module.
It does not require any external libraries to be added.

Design Principles

Use only standard modules
Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility
Cross-platform (Linux, Mac, and Windows)
